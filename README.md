# MapboxUploader
This is the unofficial Mapbox Uploader Macro for Alteryx.

Using this macro at the end of your workflow will allow you to take all your custom geosptatial data and push it up to Mapbox via their Upload API.

Here's the basics, details and background are on my [blog](https://cmtoomey.github.io/).

## Step 2 - install MapboxUpload

    npm install -g mapbox-upload

Wait about 1m and you'll be ready to go. You should see something like this
